# MachineLearningPython
Education code for using python to try out MI algorithms with Anaconda and Tensorflow, this project is to make a proof of concept for a few different methods for using machine learning.

This project is based on a tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujTCoH21GlA&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-mP7qA9cagf68V06sko5otr

The first episode explains how to set up Anaconda and TensorFlow, this is required to run the project.
The data used in this project is from UCL's machine learning repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance
